# Steps of Progression

### This project was created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### This project should

1. Render step bubbles (Num from 1 - 5)
1. Have a next/prev button
   - When at the end of all steps (bubbles), the 'next' button will be disabled
   - When at the beginning of all steps (bubbles), the 'prev' button will be disabled
1. When next/prev buttons are clicked:
   - Line should transition between bubbles
   - Borders around each individual bubble should become emboldened or highlighted
